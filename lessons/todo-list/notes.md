# Getting Started

- create a `package.json`
  - In the terminal you can use the cli command: `npm init -y`
- install our dependencies
  - express: `npm install express`
- create a `.gitignore` file
  - `/node_modules` is typed typed into it.
- create a `app.js`
- updated our `package.json` with `app.js` instead of `index.js`
- starting up the server typing `nodemon`
  - to restart a nodemon you can resave a file or type `rs` in the terminal

## Boiler Plate for Starting Server

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const PORT = 4000;

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`server is running on port: ${PORT}`);
});
```

## CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

- Create : POST
- Read : GET
- Update : PATCH
- Delete : DELETE

## Preparing our server to handle JSON Objects

In our `app.js` we need to have this line of code:

```js
app.use(express.json());
```
## MVC

- Stands for Model View Controller
- Architecture pattern that helps our Separation of Concerns
- View - browser, Postman, curl, etc. Applications that interface with the server
- Controller - part of server application which handles logic
- Model - database schematic

## CRUD

- Create (POST & GET) - creating entry based on request content
- Read (GET) - reading entry based on request query
- Update (PUT) - updating exisiting entry based on request
- Delete (DELETE) - deleting existing entry based on request query

File structure review

``` . ``` means existing folder
``` ../ ``` means one folder back

> These can be chained, for ex:

``` ../.. ``` moves you two folders back up the tree
